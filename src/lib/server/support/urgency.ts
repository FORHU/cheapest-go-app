 * airport whose flight leaves in three hours and a customer asking how refunds work are
 * not interchangeable, and answering them in the order they happened to write is only
 * defensible if you cannot tell them apart. Since ADR-0032 every Support Chat has an
 * account behind it, and a Linked Booking carries the dates — so we can. See ADR-0039.
 *
 * Nothing here is stored. Urgency is computed in the query every time the queue is read,
 * because a booking three weeks out when the chat opened is three days out a fortnight
 * later; a column would be wrong by then unless something walked the table to refresh it.
 * The only thing written down is an Agent overruling the computation.
