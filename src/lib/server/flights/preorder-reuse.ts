/**

 * `/api/flights/book` issues a real, paid Duffel order at Step 1.5 — before the
 * traveller has entered a card. The payment screen then offers "Back to details",
 * and re-submitting from there calls `/book` again, which opens a fresh booking
 * session and buys a **second** ticket for the same trip. That is how one CRK→NRT
 * attempt became two paid EVA tickets 61 seconds apart: the same fare, once
 * quoted in USD and once in PHP after a currency change.
 *
 * Matching is on the Duffel offer id, which is the tightest key available. The
 * offer is carried in `sessionStorage` across the back-and-forth, so a genuine
 * re-submit of the same trip presents the same offer id, while a new search
 * produces a different one and is correctly treated as a new booking.
