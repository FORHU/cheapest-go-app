/**
 * Whether the markup actually covered **Platform Cost** for a given month.
 *
 * The markup is priced from estimates — it has to be, since it is applied before
 * a charge exists — and until now nothing ever compared those estimates to what
 * was really taken. `STRIPE_RATE` carried the US domestic-card figure while
 * Charge Currency is KRW, USD and PHP; Duffel's per-order fee was not modelled at
 * all. A 4% markup sat below a 4.017% break-even for months and the only thing
 * that surfaced it was an invoice screenshot arriving by chance.
 *
 * This is the loop that closes. It reads back what the booking paths now record —
 * the real Stripe fee from `booking_financial_events.metadata` for flights and
 * `bookings.provider_metadata` for hotels — and sets it beside what the model
 * assumed, so drift shows up in a query instead of in an invoice.
 *
 * Derived on every call, never stored, for the reason ADR-0026 gives: a stored
 * discrepancy is a third record that can disagree with the two it summarises.
 *
 * See docs/adr/0031-the-markup-is-flat-plus-proportional-because-platform-cost-is.md.
