/**
 * Canonical and `hreflang` URLs, and the single place that knows which locales a
 * deployment serves.
 *
 * Two shapes of deployment, decided by `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCALE`:
 *
 * - **Locked** (AirangGo sets `ko`). It serves exactly one language, at the root, with no
 *   URL prefix. A prefix does not switch language there — `airanggo.com/ja/about` renders
 *   Korean — so a locked deployment has no alternates to declare and every canonical is
 *   unprefixed. That also folds those prefixed URLs onto the real one instead of letting
 *   them stand as separate pages.
 * - **Unlocked** (CheapestGo). English at the root, `PREFIXED_LOCALES` under a prefix.
 *
 * Korean is deliberately missing from `PREFIXED_LOCALES`: a language has exactly one home
 * and Korean's is `airanggo.com` (ADR-0037). `cheapestgo.com/ko` still answers until the
 * redirect lands — it is simply no longer advertised in a sitemap or an alternate. A
 * visitor who reaches it still gets a canonical naming that same Korean URL, because
 * claiming to be the English page is what made Google discard it.
 *
 * This list lived here AND in `src/app/sitemap.ts`. Two copies are how the sitemap came to
 * advertise URLs the pages did not agree with, so there is one copy now and the sitemap
 * imports it.
