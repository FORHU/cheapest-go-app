/**
 * Canonical and `hreflang` URLs, and the single place that knows which locales a
 * deployment serves.
 *
 * Two shapes of deployment, decided by `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCALE`:
 *
 * - **Locked** (AirangGo sets `ko`). It serves exactly one language, at the root, with no
 *   URL prefix. A prefix does not switch language there — `airanggo.com/ja/about` renders
 *   Korean — so every canonical is unprefixed, which folds those prefixed URLs onto the
 *   real one instead of letting them stand as separate pages.
 * - **Unlocked** (CheapestGo). English at the root, `PREFIXED_LOCALES` under a prefix.
 *
 * Both domains declare the same `hreflang` set: all four languages, each at its own home in
 * `LANGUAGE_HOMES`. Google ignores alternates that are not confirmed from the other side, so
 * a set only one domain declared would be discarded — AirangGo naming CheapestGo's English,
 * Japanese and Chinese pages is what lets CheapestGo's Korean alternate count.
 *
 * `cheapestgo.com/ko` still answers until the redirect lands. It is in no sitemap and no
 * alternate, and a visitor who reaches it gets a canonical naming that same Korean URL,
 * because claiming to be the English page is what made Google discard it.
 *
 * The list of languages lived here AND in `src/app/sitemap.ts`. Two copies are how the
 * sitemap came to advertise URLs the pages did not agree with, so there is one copy now.
