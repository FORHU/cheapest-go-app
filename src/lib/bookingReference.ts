/**
 * The identifier CheapestGo puts on a sale.
 *
 * FORHU Inc settles several products into one Stripe account and one bank account, and
 * Stripe pays out daily as a single pooled deposit — so no per-charge field can split the
 * bank line. Attribution therefore has to happen inside Stripe, which means every charge
 * needs a reference that names the platform it came from. The old hotel reference was
 * `FORHU-<millis>-<rand>`, which named the *company* — the one thing every project shares —
 * and so carried no signal at all. Flights had no reference of ours whatsoever; admin showed
 * the airline's PNR and called it a ref.
 *
 * The prefix is derived from the brand rather than stored beside it, so a reference and its
 * `source_brand` cannot drift apart.
