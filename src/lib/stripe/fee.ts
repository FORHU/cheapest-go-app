/**
 * What Stripe actually charged us on a payment, as opposed to what pricing.ts
 * guessed it would.
 *
 * `STRIPE_RATE` has to be an estimate — the markup is computed before a charge
 * exists — but it was never checked against anything. It carried 2.9%, Stripe's
 * US domestic-card rate, while **Charge Currency** is deliberately KRW, USD and
 * PHP; a foreign-issued card paying in a non-USD currency plausibly costs nearer
 * 5.4% once the international-card and conversion surcharges land. Nothing in the
 * system would have noticed, because `balance_transaction` was read nowhere.
 *
 * Stripe reports the exact figure per charge, for free, on the balance
 * transaction. Recording it makes the estimate reconcilable rather than assumed:
 * the model still prices from `STRIPE_RATE`, and the ledger knows what was really
 * taken, so drift shows up in a query instead of in an invoice. See ADR-0036.
