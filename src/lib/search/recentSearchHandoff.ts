 * Recent searches belong to an account, not to a browser.

 * Signing out cleared them outright, so signing back in lost every destination the customer
 * had looked at (QA BG-12). Simply keeping them was not the answer: the next person at a
 * shared computer would see where the last one had been looking — the leak fixed in BG-1.
 *
 * So they are put away rather than thrown away. Sign-out files the list under the account
 * that made it; signing in takes back that account's own list. Nobody else's is ever on
 * screen, and the list stays in this browser — it is a convenience, not a synced record.
