/**
 * "Back Monday from 9:00 AM (Asia/Manila)".
 *
 * The one thing that makes an overnight wait bearable is knowing how long it is. The value
 * has been computed and returned by the API since the hours were built; nothing rendered
 * it, so a customer escalating at 3am was told only "when support hours resume".
 *
 * Formatted on the client from the current hours, so editing them in the desk changes what
 * a waiting customer sees — rather than being baked into a stored message that goes stale.
