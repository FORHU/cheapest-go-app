/**
 * Group hotel markers so the map renders a bounded number of them at any zoom.
 *
 * A city search hands the map every hotel it found — around 1,100 distinct
 * coordinates for Seoul, 966 for Athens — and one HTML `<Marker>` per hotel is the
 * dominant cost of panning, because Mapbox re-transforms every marker node each
 * frame. The map used to cope by culling to the viewport and then truncating with
 * `.slice(0, 100)`, which kept the frame rate but silently dropped hotels that were
 * inside the view and inside the user's filters. Clustering replaces the truncation:
 * nothing is discarded, it is folded into a cluster that says how many it stands for.
 *
 * Supercluster indexes every property once and answers `getClusters(bbox, zoom)`, so
 * the viewport query and the aggregation are the same operation — the map only ever
 * materialises markers for what is actually on screen.

 *     radius 60  ->  137 markers      radius 80  ->  102      radius 100  ->  87
 *
 * 80 is the choice: it holds the peak at roughly the DOM budget the old hard cap of
 * 100 was picked for, except nothing is hidden to get there. The library default of
 * 40 is far too loose for us — these are wide price pills, not dots, so markers 40px
 * apart still overlap and read as a jumble. 100 goes the other way and folds pills
 * that are plainly distinct on screen.
 *
 * `maxZoom` is the zoom past which nothing is clustered any more. 16 puts individual
 * hotels on screen at street level while still folding a dense block at district
 * level. Above it every hotel stands alone.
