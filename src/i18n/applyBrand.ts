/**
 * Restate the copy in the brand actually being served.
 *
 * The translations were written for CheapestGo and name it outright — page titles,
 * the sign-in prompt, and the privacy and cookie policies, which say which site is
 * collecting the reader's data. Served unchanged from another brand's domain those
 * sentences are simply wrong, and the policy ones name the wrong site as the one
 * doing the collecting.
 *
 * Applied once to the merged messages, so every locale is covered and no caller has
 * to pass the brand in. next-intl v4 removed `defaultTranslationValues`, which is the
 * mechanism this would otherwise use.
 *
 * The match is case-sensitive on purpose. The brand appears lowercase only inside
 * addresses — `support@cheapestgo.com`, `www.cheapestgo.com` — and those are real
 * mailboxes and hosts, not prose: rewriting them invents an address that may not
 * exist. Contact details are configuration and belong in their own setting.
