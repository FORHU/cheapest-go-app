-- Copied from cheapestgo-api-v2 db/migrations/20261016000001_flight_booking_lifecycle.sql on 2026-11-03.
--
-- Renumbered: its original version 20261016000001 is already taken here by
-- 20261016000001_flights_authorise_first.sql, and the ledger is keyed on the version alone.
-- Left as-is, apply-migrations.mjs would abort the whole step on the collision audit.
-- Same reason as the hotel lifecycle migration beside it: api-v2's migrations are never run.
--
-- The workflow of a flight booking attempt, beside the sale it may become.
--
-- `booking_sessions` is already the attempt: it holds the passengers, the contact, the fare
-- policy, the price that was charged, the PaymentIntent and the idempotency key. What it lacks is
-- a state that says where the attempt is relative to the money and the airline. Its `status` is a
-- free-form string that several code paths read and write ('pending', 'initiated',
-- 'payment_initiated', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed', 'expired', ...), and none of them can
-- say whether a card has been authorised, whether Duffel has been asked, or what to do about a
-- request that timed out.
--
-- `lifecycle_status` is that state. It carries the machine in
-- src/lib/flights/lifecycle/stateMachine.ts, and it is separate from `status` on purpose: other
-- code still reads `status`, and nothing new may. `flight_booking_events` appends one row for
-- every move, with who made it and why — the answer to "how did this get here".
--
-- Additive only. No existing column changes meaning and nothing is dropped. The code degrades to
-- today's behaviour while these are absent, so deploying before applying is safe, and so is
-- applying before deploying.
--
-- The backfill is the part to read. A new column defaults to PAYMENT_PENDING, which would make
-- every row ever written look like an attempt in flight, and the sweeper voids those. So existing
-- rows are set explicitly from their legacy status, and only rows still NULL are touched — which
-- is what makes re-running this file harmless. Applied by hand, that matters.
--
--   completed, booked  -> CONFIRMED  (the sale exists)
--   failed             -> FAILED
--   everything else    -> EXPIRED    (pending, initiated, payment_initiated, payment_authorized,
--                                     processing, expired). Inert: nothing acts on EXPIRED.
--
-- A session that was genuinely mid-flight at the moment this is applied therefore reads EXPIRED.
-- The old flow ordered with Duffel before charging, so there is no authorisation to release for
-- it; `auto-recover` and `cleanup-orphaned-duffel-orders` keep handling those as they do today.
--
-- Indexes that matter:
--   * payment_intent_id is unique where present. It is the backstop for the claim in the code
--     (`UPDATE ... WHERE lifecycle_status = 'PAYMENT_AUTHORIZED'`): two callers racing to
--     complete one payment cannot both be handed it. CHECK FIRST that no PaymentIntent is shared
--     by two sessions, or this statement fails and nothing after it runs:
--
--       SELECT payment_intent_id, count(*) FROM public.booking_sessions
--        WHERE payment_intent_id IS NOT NULL GROUP BY 1 HAVING count(*) > 1;
--
--   * (lifecycle_status, created_at) is what the sweeper walks.
--
-- The up section is one transaction: it applies whole or not at all (a duplicate PaymentIntent
-- rolls everything back rather than leaving a column with no index), and no row can be written
-- between the backfill and NOT NULL. It locks booking_sessions while it runs — a full-table
-- UPDATE and two index builds — so apply it at a quiet moment.
--
-- Applied by hand (see the migrations note in the project memory). Pipe in only the up section
-- — the down section drops what was added, so running the whole file undoes itself.
--
-- Or with dbmate (`npx dbmate --url "…?sslmode=disable" up`). `transaction:false` below is what
-- makes that work: dbmate otherwise wraps the file in a transaction of its own, the COMMIT here
-- ends it early, and dbmate fails with "pq: unexpected transaction status idle" after the SQL
-- has already committed. With it, this file's own BEGIN … COMMIT is the only transaction.
--
-- After applying: `prisma db pull` to bring the models into prisma/schema.prisma. The code uses
-- raw SQL against these until then, so nothing waits on it.
--
-- `duffel_pre_order_*` are left alone. The new flow stops writing them; the old rows keep theirs.
