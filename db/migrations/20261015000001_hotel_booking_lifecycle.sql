-- Copied from cheapestgo-api-v2 db/migrations/20261015000001_hotel_booking_lifecycle.sql on 2026-11-03.
--
-- api-v2 authored it but nothing applies api-v2's migrations: deploy-dev.yml has no migration
-- step, and v1's deploy is the only thing that runs scratch/apply-migrations.mjs. So these four
-- tables were never created, hotel_bookings has never existed in production, and the whole v2
-- lifecycle — including the webhook that finishes a booking when the browser never comes back —
-- has been failing silently since launch, because lifecycle.open is deliberately never fatal.
-- Migration ownership moves to api-v2 at cutover; until then it lives here, where it runs.
--
-- The workflow of a hotel booking attempt, beside the sale it may become.
--
-- `bookings` records a sale: it is written once the supplier has confirmed and the payment has
-- been captured, and trips, invoices, admin and the mobile app all read it. Everything before
-- that moment — and everything that goes wrong on the way to it — lived in a free-form status
-- string or nowhere. A payment that was authorised and then lost its browser had no row at all;
-- a supplier call that timed out left no record of which side of it the money was on.
--
-- These four tables are the attempt. `hotel_bookings` is the aggregate and carries the state
-- machine in src/lib/hotels/lifecycle/stateMachine.ts; `hotel_booking_events` appends one row
-- for every move, with who moved it and why; `hotel_booking_guests` and
-- `hotel_booking_payments` hold what the booking was for and what was authorised for it.
-- The same reference string links an attempt to the `bookings` row it becomes.
--
-- Additive only. No existing table or column changes, and nothing here is read by the app until
-- the code that writes it is deployed — the code degrades to today's behaviour while these
-- tables are absent, so deploying before applying is safe, and so is applying before deploying.
--
-- Indexes that matter:
--   * booking_reference and payment_intent_id are unique. The second is the backstop for the
--     claim in the code (`UPDATE ... WHERE status = 'PAYMENT_AUTHORIZED'`): two callers racing
--     to complete one payment cannot both create it.
--   * (user_id, prebook_ref) is unique only while the attempt is in flight, so a traveller who
--     abandons a payment and tries again is not blocked by their own history.
--   * (status, created_at) is what the sweeper walks.
--
-- Applied by hand (see the migrations note in the project memory). Pipe in only the up section
-- — the down section drops the tables, so running the whole file undoes itself.
--
-- After applying: `prisma db pull` to bring the models into prisma/schema.prisma. The code
-- uses raw SQL against these tables until then, so nothing waits on it.
